# Content Access via Namespace

Using the [namespaces/list](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams#team-namespaces-list) endpoint will allow access to all content on a team including team member folders, shared folders, the root team folder, and any app folders.

To list and access all namespaces for a team you must use an admin team member account. This script allows you to enter the email of a team administrator and then list all content across all namespaces on a team.
